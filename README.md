# cascade

This is a little creation I cooked up with Jquery, JQuery Color, and Knockout that creates a cascade of tiles on the screen (top left to bottom right) and pulses color updates through them. The number of rows and columns, as well as the margin between tiles, can be adjusted in real time. You can also pause and resume color updates on demand.
